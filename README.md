# ForestBot
New command handler, feel free to make pull requests to add features or clean up my code!
note: a lot of things are unfinished.

also keep in mind: This bot will NOT work if you do not either take out each database query function, or you setup a mysql database the exact same as I have mine setup.

Requirements to run the bot: <br>
  -mysql database (kinda optional not really) <br>
  -nodejs <br>
  -a computer <br>
  -basic understanding of nodejs <br>
  
  npm install <br>
  npm start
